# UFO Sighting 
https://imantal.github.io/UFO-Sighting/
## Overview of Project
For this project, JavaScript(JS) is used as the primary coding language to create a dynamic table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JS array. The table has the ability to filter the data based on the certain criteria defined by the user. HTML is used for easy viewing of the table and interaction with the user. The web page is customized using Bootstrap.
## Results
The final product of this project is an HTML page which is basically the window to the UFOs data. It displays a title, an article summary about UFOs and a filterable table containing UFO sighting data. A JS code is developed to create a table from the JS file and to filter the table based on the user criteria including:

- Date of observation
- City in which UFO observed
- State in which UFO observed
- Country in which UFO observed
- Shape of UFO 

User can enter all the desired criteria listed above or only a subset of those. The first image below shows the developed webpage containing the original table. The second one is an example of the table whose data is filtered based on the user's criteria (City="Benton")

## Drawbacks
- One drawback of this webpage is that the UFO sighting data lacks authentication. It will be useful to have data of how many people have independently reported the UFOs.
- Another drawback is that the volume of the data is a bit large and it is hard for a user to screen through the large table
## Recommendations
It will be useful if the user can get some statistical analysis of UFO sighting events. For example, the average sighting period, the areas in the world which have the most sightings and the areas that have the least number of sightings
It will be helpful to provide an interactive map showing locations of the UFO sighting
